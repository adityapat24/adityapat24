### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Computer Science student at Northeastern University with a strong interest in full-stack development, API design, and software development. 
I'm passionate about building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly software that solves real-world problems. The pinned repositories highlight my work for organizations
HackBeanpot and Code4Community and also contain additional software development projects done as final projects for classes. Upon request, access will be given to repositories
containing CS2510 and CS3500 work.
